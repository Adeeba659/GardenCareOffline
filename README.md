# GardenCare

GardenCare is a user-friendly Flutter mobile app that simplifies plant identification and disease detection. Utilizing a ResNet-50 model, the app enables users to snap pictures or select from the gallery to identify plants and detect diseases in their leaves with precision. The app also offers a plant encyclopedia section showcasing valuable information about various plant types.

## Key Features:

### Plant Identification: 
Identifies plants by capturing images or selecting from the gallery. GardenCare's ResNet-50 model quickly analyzes the pictures to recognize the plant species.

### Disease Detection: 
Detect diseases in plant leaves accurately. The ResNet-50 model can diagnose common diseases, including Grape Black Rot, Peach Bacterial Spot, Rose Black Spot, and Tomato Late Blight.

### Plant Encyclopedia: 
Access plant encyclopedia with details about different plants, including their characteristics and maintenance tips.

### History: 
View a history of previously identified plants and disease detection results, including the images taken during identification.

## ResNet-50 Model:

GardenCare utilizes a powerful ResNet-50 model, trained on TensorFlow, for disease detection. The model recognizes plants such as Grape, Peach, Rose, and Tomato, along with diseases like Grape Black Rot, Peach Bacterial Spot, Rose Black Spot, and Tomato Late Blight. The TFLite model is available offline on the mobile device for quick disease detection.

GardenCare aims to make plant care more enjoyable for gardening enthusiasts. Experience the joy of caring for your plants with GardenCare!
